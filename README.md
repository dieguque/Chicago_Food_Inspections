Due to COVID-19 the **City of Chicago** is having less people available for the food inspections, and those few available have to take extreme measures when are doing inspections. The *Chicago Department of Public Health’s Food Protection Program** is trying to optimize the in-person inspections creating a model to predict when the food establishments fail or pass an inspection.
